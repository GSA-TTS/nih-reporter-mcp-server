    "abstract_text": "This application is being submitted in response to the Notice of Special Interest (NOSI) identified as NOT-CA-\n24-044.\nUterine serous carcinomas (USC) represent 10% of endometrial cancers (EC) but account for nearly 40% of\ndeaths from the disease. This disproportionate difference between incidence and death emphasizes the need to\nimprove treatment strategies. One new potential therapeutical approach is the immunotherapy which can induce\na dramatic and durable tumor regression across several cancer types, including other subtypes of EC, but has\nyet to have success in the treatment of USC. Characterization of the immune tumor microenvironment (TME) is\na prerequisite for the selection of the optimal immunotherapy combinations. Emerging data show that USC\ntissues are characterized by a high number of myeloid cells, including M2-like tumor associated macrophages\n(TAM) and granulocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (G-MDSC). However, little is known about the tumor\nsecreted factors that induce the TAM and G-MDSC recruitment and modulate their functional activities in USC.\nWe have identified EGFL6 (EGF like domain multiple 6) as a new factor regulating the recruitment and functions\nof TAM and G-MDSC in the HGSOC and potentially the USC TME. Egfl6 is highly expressed in uterine cancer,\nincluding USC. Mice overexpressing Egfl6 have an increased numbers of bone marrow (BM) G-MDSC and\ndevelop spontaneous tumors in the uterus. Treatment with recombinant protein Egfl6 of BM derived myeloid cells\nwas associated with an increase Syk activation and promoted differentiation of G-MDSCs towards an\nimmunosuppressive phenotype. Moreover, tumor expression of Egfl6 enhanced tumor growth and increased\ntumor infiltration of G-MDSC and M2-like TAM. Furthermore, combined treatment of a-Egfl6 and a-PD-L1\nreduced numbers of pro-tumorigenic TAM and G-MDSC resulting in survival rate prolongation of serous ovarian\ncancer bearing mice. Furthermore, SYK is highly expressed in human USC tissue samples. We hypothesize\nthat Egfl6, via Syk activation, induces the recruitment of TAM and G-MDSC and enhances their\nimmunosuppressive phenotype resulting in the inhibition of anti-tumor immune response. To test our\nhypothesis, we propose: SA1. To determine the role of Egfl6/Syk axis in TAM and G-MDSC infiltrating USC.\nUsing a syngeneic mouse model of USC, we will use R788, a potent Syk inhibitor, to determine the role of Syk\nin the Egfl6-dependent regulatory axis controlling TAM and G-MDSC. We will also evaluate the impact of a-\nEgfl6 or R788 in combination with a-PDL1 on anti-tumor immunity in USC. SA2. To evaluate Egfl6 expression\nand the immune TME in USC patients. The characterization of the immune TME can help to make substantial\nprogress in the identification of the likelihood of response to immunotherapies. We will evaluate 1) EGFL6 and\nSYK expression, and 2) the abundance and phenotype of tumor infiltrating immune cells. Because USC is more\ncommon in Black vs White women, we will also compare the immune USC TME of Black vs White Women.",

    "phr_text": "The uterine serous cancer (USC) tumor microenviroment is characterized by large numbers of\nimmunosuppressive myeloid cells that might reduce the effectiveness of current immunotherapies. Our data\nsuggest that Egfl6, a protein secreted by tumor cells, induces the activaction of Syk factor in myeloid cells\npromoting their immunosuppressive phenotype. In this study, we will determine the role of Egfl6/Syk axis in\nUSC and evaluate the efficacy of Egfl6 and/or Syk inhibition as an adjuvant to immunotherapy.",
